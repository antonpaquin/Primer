This describes a protocol for two way communication on two busses without a 
clock signal.

This protocol probably has a name but I don't know what it is.

A sends data to B, then B sends a response back to A.

A drives the REQ signal, and sends data_a on the bus A Out B In (AOBI)
B drives the ACK signal, and sends data_b on the bus B Out A In (BOAI)

0. Initial --  A writes to AOBI then asserts REQ
	REQ = 1
	ACK = 0
	BUS_AOBI = data_a
	BUS_BOAI = don't care

1. B latches AOBI, disables BOAI (if enabled), then asserts ACK
        REQ = 1
	ACK = 1
	BUS_AOBI = data_a
	BUS_BOAI = don't care

2. A lowers REQ and disables AOBI
	REQ = 0
	ACK = 1
	BUS_AOBI = don't care
	BUS_BOAI = don't care

3. B writes to BOAI then lowers ACK
	REQ = 0
	ACK = 0
	BUS_AOBI = don't care
	BUS_BOAI = data_b

4. A latches BOAI, writes AOBI, then asserts REQ
	REQ = 1
	ACK = 0
	BUS_AOBI = data_a
	BUS_BOAI = data_b

5. (State 1)
