This describes a protocol for two way communication on two busses without a 
clock signal.

This protocol probably has a name but I don't know what it is.

A sends data to B, then B sends a response back to A.

A drives the REQ signal, and sends data_a on the bus A Out B In (AOBI)
B drives the ACK signal, and sends data_b on the bus B Out A In (BOAI)

0. Initial --  Both sides ready (B lowers ACK)
	REQ = 0
	ACK = 0
	BUS_AOBI = don't care
	BUS_BOAI = don't care

1. A writes to AOBI and then raises REQ
        REQ = 1
	ACK = 0
	BUS_AOBI = data_a
	BUS_BOAI = don't care

2. B reads, then writes to BOAI, then raises ACK
	REQ = 1
	ACK = 1
	BUS_AOBI = data_a
	BUS_BOAI = data_b

3. A reads, then lowers REQ
	REQ = 0
	ACK = 1
	BUS_AOBI = don't care
	BUS_BOAI = data_b

4. (State 0)
